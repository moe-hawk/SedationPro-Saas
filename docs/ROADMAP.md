# Roadmap

Production rebuild of the Apex Dental IV-sedation app as a Capacitor +
Vue 3 hybrid for the App Store and Google Play.

The nine phases below take the project from an empty repo to a submitted
build. Each phase has a single deliverable, an explicit exit gate, and
its scope is small enough to land in one focused session.

## Phase 0 — Foundation scaffold ✅

**Deliverable.** Empty repo to a working pnpm workspace monorepo with CI,
formatting, typecheck, test, and build all wired up.

**Shipped.**

- pnpm 10 + Node 22 + TS 5.9 strict mode across four workspaces.
- `apps/mobile` (Vue 3.5 + Vite 6 + Pinia + Vue Router + Capacitor 6.2)
  with iOS-style design tokens (`tokens.css`) and base typography
  (`base.css`).
- `packages/clinical`, `packages/ui`, `packages/persistence` placeholders.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — format · typecheck · test · build on push
  and PR.
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, `LICENSE` (proprietary placeholder).

**Exit gate.** All four `pnpm` scripts green on a clean
`--frozen-lockfile` install. Bundle ~38 KB gzipped.

## Phase 1 — Clinical engine ✅

**Deliverable.** Pure-TS engine implementing every clinical rule the legacy
app encoded, with the formulary modelled as data so practices can ship
their own drugs and ceilings without touching code.

**Shipped.**

- `DEFAULT_FORMULARY` with Apex's drugs (5 IV, 3 oral, 1 bedtime,
  5 local anesthetics), ceilings, and wait windows.
- Dosing math: half-life decay, IV synergy ceiling (benzo reduced 30%
  when any opioid is on board), Malamed combined-percent with active-dose
  decay, oral anxiolytic max-dose calculator.
- Gates: OSA-diazepam interlock, release eligibility (20 min standard,
  120 min after flumazenil), pre-med wait (30 min), drug timers (Versed
  cooling/ramping/ready, Fentanyl cooling/ready), last-exam age-tiered
  cutoffs, Phase 1 required-fields registry.
- Vitals: BMI categories (CDC ranges), BP stages (AHA 2017+), SpO₂ tiers.
- Protocols: nicotine pre-op cessation tiers.
- 94 Vitest cases, 99.21 % statement coverage, 100 % function coverage.

**Exit gate.** Coverage ≥ 80 %, all engine functions accept a `Formulary`
override, no I/O or non-deterministic calls inside the engine.

## Phase 2 — UI primitives (`@sedation-pro/ui`) ✅

**Deliverable.** Headless Vue 3 primitives consumed by `apps/mobile`.
Components take props in, emit events out, and hold no clinical state —
the contract that keeps the Phase 3 nav drawer and sticky bar honest as
projections of a shared store.

**Shipped.**

- Design tokens moved into the package: `@sedation-pro/ui/styles`
  (typography, 4px spacing, motion easings, dark palette, drug-tone
  swatches, `--ph1..ph4` phase tints).
- Layout: `<UiCard>` (phase tint + active/completed), `<UiRow>`,
  `<UiStack>`.
- Action: `<UiButton>` (neutral/primary/success/danger), `<UiDrugButton>`
  (12 drug tones, 3-state idle/locked/logged model).
- Form: `<UiField>`, `<UiTextInput>`, `<UiNumberInput>`, `<UiSelect>`,
  `<UiCheckbox>` (iOS dot + danger variant), `<UiBpInput>`.
- Display: `<UiBanner>`, `<UiDrugSwatch>`, `<UiPercentBar>` (auto-derives
  severity), `<UiStatusPill>`, `<UiTimerPill>` (cooling / ramping /
  ready).
- Vitest + happy-dom + @vue/test-utils smoke suite: every primitive
  mounts, click suppression respected on locked / logged / disabled
  states, percent-bar severity thresholds verified at boundaries.
- `apps/mobile`'s `HomeView` rebuilt as a live demo wiring every
  primitive against the clinical engine.

**Exit gate.** Met. `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and
`pnpm format:check` all green; production bundle ~46.5 KB gzipped.

**Deferred to Phase 3 / later.** `<UiToast>`, `<UiUndoToast>`,
`<UiModal>`, `<UiBottomSheet>` — these need a store backbone (queue,
focus management) and ship as part of the shell. The 5 syringe SVGs
ship in Phase 6 alongside the drug-tile sub-content they belong to.

## Phase 3 — App shell + navigation ✅

**Deliverable.** The four-phase workflow scaffolding mounted in
`apps/mobile`: sticky progress bar, slide-in nav drawer, undo toast,
router with phase gating. No clinical content yet — just the shell that
hosts it. Every surface reads from the same Pinia stores so the nav and
sticky bar can never drift.

**Shipped.**

- Pinia stores: `useSessionStore` (current phase/step + per-phase
  step memory + drawer state), `useEventLogStore` (chronological log,
  remove-by-id), `useUndoStore` (`stamp()` + `undo()` with 25-entry
  cap), `useToastStore` (single-active toast with auto-dismiss),
  `usePatientStore` (Phase 1 inputs feeding `phase1Completeness`).
- Shell components: `StickyBar` (drawer toggle, live clearance bar in
  Phase 1, undo button, emergency button), `NavDrawer` (avatar,
  patient summary pills, phase entries with lock state), `UndoToast`
  (slide-in with tone-tinted accent).
- Routes: `/phase/1..4`, `/quick-reference`, `/ui-demo`, plus root and
  catch-all redirects.
- Phase gating: a `router.beforeEach` guard rewrites attempts to enter
  Phase 2/3/4 back to `/phase/1` while `isPhase1Complete` is false; the
  nav drawer disables those rows from the same source.
- `apps/mobile`'s `App.vue` now mounts the shell once; the active route
  fills the body.
- Tests: `src/stores/shell.test.ts` covers session step memory, undo
  round-trip, undo stack cap, and `phase1Completeness` integration
  including the diabetic-conditional glucose field. 6 tests, all green.

**Exit gate.** Met. All four `pnpm` scripts green; bundle 46.45 KB
gzipped main + per-route code-split chunks.

## Phase 4 — Assessment + premed screens ⏳

**Deliverable.** Phase 1 (pre-sedation assessment) and Phase 2 (oral
premedication) screens, fully wired to the clinical engine.

**Scope.**

- Phase 1 cards: Patient ID · Caregiver · Vitals & Metrics · Medical
  History · Social Screening · Safety Checklist · Bedtime Premedication.
- Live BMI / BP / SpO₂ / nicotine readouts via `@sedation-pro/clinical`.
- Phase 1 required-fields driven by `PHASE1_REQUIRED_FIELDS`. Clearance
  percentage in sticky bar.
- Diazepam button cluster uses `diazepamGate` — blocks on missing OSA,
  shows override modal on documented OSA/CPAP.
- Phase 2: Triazolam · Lorazepam · Hydroxyzine dose buttons with
  max-dose hint from `triazolamMax`/`lorazepamMax` (using entered
  weight). Logs to the event store with timestamp.

**Exit gate.** Filling in mock patient data unlocks Phase 2; a premed tap
logs a stamped event and updates the sticky bar.

## Phase 5 — Persistence + custom formularies ⏳

**Deliverable.** `@sedation-pro/persistence` package — adapter interface,
Capacitor Preferences implementation, and IndexedDB fallback for web
development.

**Scope.**

- `StorageAdapter` interface (get / set / delete / clear, all
  Promise-based).
- Capacitor `Preferences` plugin wrapper.
- Web IndexedDB fallback (via `idb-keyval`) used when Capacitor is
  unavailable.
- Stores: current session (autosave + restore on reload), practice
  profile (provider name, practice name, assistants list), **custom
  formulary** (replaces or extends `DEFAULT_FORMULARY`).
- Schema versioning so a stored session from v0.1.x can migrate forward
  on engine upgrades.
- Custom-formulary editor UI hidden behind a settings screen — full
  editing in Phase 8.

**Exit gate.** Reload preserves a half-filled Phase 1 session; a custom
formulary entry overrides `DEFAULT_FORMULARY` for one engine call.

## Phase 6 — IV sedation + recovery + clinical note ⏳

**Deliverable.** Phase 3 (IV sedation and procedure) plus Phase 4
(recovery, discharge, and clinical note) screens.

**Scope.**

- Phase 3: N₂O on/off, IV start (with pre-med wait chip), initial dose,
  additional doses, sedation level vitals, procedure start, local
  anesthesia. All buttons use `exec()` cooldown + check overlay.
- Drug timer pills powered by `versedTimer` / `fentanylTimer`.
- IV sedation max-dose tracker + Malamed combined-percent card live
  via `ivSedationStatus` / `localCombined`.
- Reversal panel: flumazenil + naloxone with the process boxes the
  legacy app shows on first tap.
- Phase 4: recovery vitals stamp, IV-out countdown chip
  (`releaseEligibility`), discharge checklist, release-patient button
  (with "do not dismiss" guards), clinical note review bottom sheet,
  signature pad, generated clinical note ready to print or share.

**Exit gate.** A full mock session — Phase 1 → release — produces a
clinical note that includes every logged event in chronological order,
with the provider's signature.

## Phase 7 — Native integration ⏳

**Deliverable.** Real iOS and Android builds running on device.

**Scope.**

- `cap add ios` + `cap add android` on developer machines (not in CI).
- Wake-lock plugin (`@capacitor-community/keep-awake` or platform APIs).
- Haptics plugin (`@capacitor/haptics`) — replaces the web
  `navigator.vibrate` patterns from the legacy app.
- Native share for clinical-note export (`@capacitor/share`).
- Safe-area insets handled in CSS (already wired in `base.css`).
- Status bar styling, splash screen, app icon (1024 + 512).
- Permissions plist / manifest entries for the plugins above.

**Exit gate.** App installs from Xcode and Android Studio onto physical
devices; running a mock session keeps the screen awake and produces
haptic feedback on dose taps.

## Phase 8 — Store readiness ⏳

**Deliverable.** App Store Connect and Google Play Console listings
populated, screenshots prepared, privacy and clinical disclaimers
authored, internal audit passed.

**Scope.**

- Real `appId` chosen and replaced (placeholder is
  `com.example.sedationpro` — irreversible after first upload).
- Screenshots at required device sizes (`tools/store-assets/`).
- App Store description, keywords, support URL, marketing URL, privacy
  policy URL.
- App Privacy disclosures (data collection: none by default; sessions
  stored locally only unless the practice opts into export).
- Clinical / medical-device disclaimer: this app is a documentation aid,
  not a medical device; clinical decisions remain the prescriber's
  responsibility.
- Settings screen for practice profile + custom formulary editor.
- Final security review: no PHI in logs, no third-party trackers, all
  storage local, no network calls without explicit user action.

**Exit gate.** TestFlight build delivered to the practice; internal
review sign-off; legal review of disclaimers complete.

## Phase 9 — Submission + launch ⏳

**Deliverable.** App accepted on both stores and a v1.0.0 tagged
release.

**Scope.**

- App Store: submit via Xcode → App Store Connect, respond to review
  notes, hit "Release this version" once approved.
- Google Play: production track release via Play Console, complete the
  data safety form, await review.
- Post-launch: crash reporting (opt-in), version tag, changelog,
  release notes.
- A first practice runs a real (non-clinical) dry run end-to-end with
  staff observation — sign-off before clinical use.

**Exit gate.** Both store listings live, the practice has installed the
production build, a recorded dry-run case completes without engine
errors or undo regrets.

## Out of scope (for v1)

- Multi-tenant cloud sync — sessions stay on-device.
- Telehealth / remote monitoring.
- Pediatric sedation — adult workflow only.
- Non-IV sedation modalities beyond oral premedication.
- EHR integration — exportable / copyable / shareable note only in v1.
  Open Dental write-back is designed below as a post-v1 candidate.

Each is a candidate for v2 once v1 is live and stable.

## Post-v1 candidate — Open Dental note write-back

**Intent.** One-tap "send to chart": resolve the patient in the
practice's Open Dental by MRN, then write the generated clinical note
into their record. Builds directly on the existing
`clinicalNoteToText()` serializer — the note is already a stable,
testable string contract, so this is an export adapter plus the
compliance scaffolding around it, not a rewrite.

**API shape (researched May 2026 against the Open Dental REST API v1).**

- Base URL `https://api.opendental.com/api/v1`,
  `Content-Type: application/json`.
- Auth header: `Authorization: ODFHIR {DeveloperKey}/{CustomerKey}`.
  Developer key from the Open Dental Developer Portal
  (vendor.relations@opendental.com, 1–3 business days); the Customer
  key is per practice/developer pair. This is a bearer credential —
  it must live in secure native storage (Capacitor Preferences /
  Keychain), never in localStorage or the JS bundle.
- Permissions + throttling: read-only keys (`ApiReadAll`) are
  throttled to 1 request / 5 s; any write permission (e.g.
  `ApiComm`) relaxes to 1 request / 1 s. One note per case is far
  under either limit.

**Flow.**

1. **Resolve patient (needs read access — already held):**
   `GET /patients?ChartNumber={MRN}`. Open Dental has _no dedicated
   MRN field_ — the practice's MRN must map to `ChartNumber`
   (≤ 15 chars) or a custom `PatField`. Search is partial-match and
   case-insensitive, so the adapter must exact-match and, given the
   wrong-patient stakes, cross-check name + birthdate before writing.
   Returns `PatNum` (the internal key for step 2).
2. **Write the note (needs write access — `ApiComm`, to be purchased):**
   `POST /commlogs` with
   `{ PatNum, Note: clinicalNoteToText(note), CommDateTime, commType }`.
   Commlogs is the right target: append-only (every POST is a new
   timestamped entry), patient-keyed, free-text body. _Not_
   `PatientNotes` — that's a single 1:1 field per patient and `PUT`
   replaces it (no per-visit history). `ProcNotes` is a fallback only
   if the visit must attach to a specific `ProcNum`.

**Open risks to design around (not yet solved).**

- PHI in transit flips the app's "local-only, no network without
  explicit action" stance — needs a BAA with Open Dental, an audit
  trail of what was sent and when, and a _non-silent_ failure path
  (a chart write that fails the way localStorage silently fails would
  be a documentation gap, not a cosmetic one).
- MRN→ChartNumber mapping is practice-configured and not guaranteed
  unique/populated; the patient-match step is itself a wrong-patient
  surface and needs a confirm-before-send gate.
- Requires the practice's Open Dental to expose the remote API
  (eConnector / cloud), not just Local/Service mode.
